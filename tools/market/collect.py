"""One collector run: for each pack whose market traded today, ask its sources, check every answer, merge
into the pack's folder, report health; then describe every pack in index.json (lightning/market/packs.py).

A failing source never stops the others and never removes a price: its pack keeps its last good closes,
and its health.json counts failures in a row so the workflow can open an issue (proposal › Keeping it alive).
Published closes are never changed by a run; a different value for a published day is only reported."""
