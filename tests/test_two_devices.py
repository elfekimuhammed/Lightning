"""Mohab with a phone and a PC: how a normal user moves between them, through the screens only.

Each device is a real profile app with its own folders (the phone in the phone frame, guideline Part C), and Mohab
only clicks, types and reads. The other sync tests prove the protocol; this file proves the journey:

1. He started on the PC, then moves the profile to the phone; every row and figure comes with it, and the PC
   cannot open its old copy for writing.
2. On the bus he fixes a wrong amount and adds a ride on the phone; at his desk the PC borrows the ledger and shows
   exactly the phone's edits; he edits and deletes on the PC while the phone only reads; Hand back returns it.
3. A form left open on one device never saves over the other's work; a save on a lent phone answers a phone page
   that names the PC and leads to Devices, and an open page shows the hand-over by itself.
4. He forgets to hand back and goes home: the PC keeps his edits sealed; the next morning they reach the phone.
5. The PC is out of reach for good: the phone takes the ledger back, and the PC says so and borrows again.
6. The phone is locked when the PC hands back: the changes wait and go in when he unlocks it; meanwhile a tap
   shows One moment, never the profile chooser.
7. A second PC at home cannot borrow while the office PC has it; a wrong password borrows nothing.

After every hand-over both devices show the same figures. A gap found here is a strict expected failure until fixed.
