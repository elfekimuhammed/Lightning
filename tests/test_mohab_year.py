"""Mohab's year, through the screens only: the reference workflow in docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md.

Mohab is 31, salaried, in Cairo. He starts with an empty Lightning on 30 September 2026, sets up the
last three months, and then lives a year in it: October 2026 to September 2027. He only does what a
person can do in the app: open pages, follow links, fill in the forms on the page and press their
buttons (tests/screens.py). Along the way he asks the questions a salaried person asks. Each one is
answered by starting at the Overview and clicking through to the page that answers it, and the test
for that question checks both the route he took and what the page told him.

Each open product gap has a direct screen assertion. When a gap is fixed, update its assertion and
the Overview's "Today" column in docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md together.

What Mohab's test focuses on. Mohab is a real Egyptian user, not a tester: he judges Lightning by whether
he gets the right answer quickly, with as little effort and as few words to decode as possible.
Lightning ships as a Windows app (a WebView2 window over the same pages), so every check is a screen
he would see there.
- Right answers: every figure reconciles across tabs and after a year of real life (fees, refunds,
  a bonus, early pay, a raise, Eid, installments, a sale, a job change).
- Usability: each question is answered by starting at the Overview and clicking through; the route is
  checked, and a dead end, a missing way back or a lost half-done task is a failure.
- Efficiency: count the effort. One typed balance instead of clearing lines one by one; one fix
  instead of one per row; nothing he must re-enter.
- Speed: pages must feel instant on an ordinary PC, encrypted, in the WebView2 window; long
  periods stay summarised (months, not 365 days) and pages stay light.
- Simplicity: the fewest controls and choices that do the job; no placeholder text to delete, no
  feature he needs a manual for.
- Clarity: plain words and numbers a person can read (no "System", no −1,351.7%), the date or period
  every figure belongs to, and a warning when something cannot work as planned.
- UI: compact rows, readable messages, and layouts that work in the app window and on a phone.
User feedback (the "user feedback" folder) is added here as steps Mohab takes and checked by screen
assertions. Speed and look are judged on a real PC and in a browser; this file covers what screens show.
