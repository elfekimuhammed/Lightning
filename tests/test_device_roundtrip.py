"""Task 04b: the committed encrypted dummy profile gives the same report on every platform.

Windows CI runs this file too, and the Android probe runs the same `lightning.runtime.roundtrip` against the
same fixture and compares with the same `expected.json`, so equal lines mean equal figures, inventory and
key recovery on Linux, Windows and the phone."""
