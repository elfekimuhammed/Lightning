"""One name, one meaning, one formula and one function for every figure Lightning reports.

Lightning has three layers:

- **Ledger** — real money. Posted transactions: where money actually came from and went.
- **Plan** — what-if. Budgets, reserves, scheduled bills and loans, sale factors and the forecast.
  Nothing in it moves money; it sits on top of the ledger to help you plan.
- **Report** — reads the other two and presents them. It stores nothing of its own.

Every figure below is shown by the report layer. Its ``layer`` says where its inputs come from
(the ledger, the plan, or both), and ``function`` names the one piece of code that computes it.
Screens read labels and formulas from here, so a figure is never called one thing on one tab and
something else on another, and a derived figure is a formula of other figures, never computed a
second way. docs/GLOSSARY.md is generated from this table; tests keep them in step and check that
every ``function`` exists.
