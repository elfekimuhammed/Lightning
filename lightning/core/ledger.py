"""Posting rules — the heart of the financial core. Pure Python, no database.

Every transaction (the document the user sees) is stored as one or more ledger lines.
All balances and reports are derived from ledger lines only.

Effects:
- INFLOW    value entering your finances (salary, interest)       -> needs an INFLOW category
- OUTFLOW   value leaving your finances (groceries, fees)         -> needs an OUTFLOW category
- INTERNAL  value moving inside your finances (transfers, buys)   -> must net to zero
- OPENING   balance that existed before you started tracking      -> no category

Net-worth equation (per period):
    closing = opening + inflows - outflows + revaluation + new balances added

Cash lines vs investment lines:
- cash:        quantity == amount, unit price 1
- investment:  quantity = units (shares, fund units, grams); unit_price = the trade price;
               amount = what the units cost (buy, incl. fees) or fetched (sell, net of fees).
               So a buy or sell always nets to zero against its cash line; gains show as revaluation.
