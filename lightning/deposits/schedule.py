"""A certificate's interest the way the bank pays it, as pure functions of its terms (no database).

``periods`` lists each interest period from purchase to maturity with what it earns; the payout schedule
(``events``) and the value earned to date (``accrued``) both read it, so the forecast, the holding's value and the
maturity amount always agree.

IV-12J4: a variable certificate's rate changes are dated. ``rates`` is a list of ``(effective date, annual rate)``;
each period earns at the rate in force on its first day (the purchase rate until the first change).
IV-12J3: a certificate that pays at maturity (simple at maturity, or compound) is worth its principal plus the
interest earned so far, an estimate from its terms; the redemption then records what the bank actually paid.
