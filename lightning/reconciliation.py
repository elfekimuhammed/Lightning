"""Check an account against the balance the bank shows, and settle a small difference.

The user types the ending balance from the bank (or wallet app) on a date. Lightning compares it with the
account's own cash balance on that date. A small difference is settled with one balance adjustment, posted as
ordinary Money out (Other Personal) or Money in (Other Income), so it counts in spending and income like any
other row. A big difference is never adjusted: the user reviews the register or reimports the statement.
