"""Rules with conditions: pure functions over a transaction dict, no database inside.

A rule says "when these hold, file it here": conditions on the counterparty, notes, amount, account or
direction, joined by all or any; actions that set a category, add #tags to the notes, or split part of an
expense into other categories. Rules run most specific first (Actual Budget's scores: "is" beats "one of",
which beats a range, which beats "more than", which beats "contains"), then in the order they were made.
The first matching rule that sets a category decides it; every matching rule adds its tags.
