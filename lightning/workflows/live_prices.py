"""Each copy of Lightning fetches its own prices from the sources (owner, 2026-10-05; docs/proposals/market_data.md
› How the app gets prices).

When: never daily by itself. Month-end closes matter most, because the monthly revaluation is posted from them,
so on opening a profile the app fetches only when a month-end has passed that a held investment has no price
for: open it three days after the month ends and it fetches that month-end's close. It tries at most once a
day by itself, so a source that is down never slows every start. Update prices fetches at any time: every
held investment's latest close and every month-end it lacks.

Funds: Mubasher names each fund by its own number (EG:FUND:4104). A held fund without one is matched by name
against the fund list the app downloads anyway (only an exact match, case, punctuation and the word "fund"
aside, and only when one fund has that name); the number is then kept. A fund whose name differs gets its
number from its Mubasher page, pasted on Edit investment.

Gold: an estimate from the world price, per gram of each purity: Yahoo's gold close in dollars an ounce
(GC=F) ÷ 31.1034768 grams × the dollar's rate in pounds (EGP=X) × karat ÷ 24. It prices the gold price
references your gold items use (18K, 21K, 24K) and gold held by the gram. Egyptian shops price above or below
the world price; a price you type (your shop's) wins for its day.

How: one request for a whole board's latest closes (EGX from TradingView, every Egyptian fund from Mubasher),
so asking reveals nothing about what you hold; a month-end close comes from the instrument's history (Yahoo
for stocks, Mubasher for funds). Only closes that are final are kept: during trading hours today's moving
price is skipped. Prices are saved with source ONLINE, so a price you type for the same day wins. What the
sources cannot give is listed for Needs you, never guessed. The shared price files (the daily collector's
backup) stay one click away on Investment prices, and typing a price always works.

The work is split so the network never holds the database: plan() reads, gather() only fetches, save() writes.
Opening a profile starts gather() on its own thread and the profile opens at once; the next page saves what it
found on the database's own thread (an encrypted profile is used from one thread only) and says so.
