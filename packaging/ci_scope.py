"""What each run of the app workflow (.github/workflows/desktop-probe.yml) does. Standard library only.

    python packaging/ci_scope.py                      # GitHub outputs for this run (see main)
    python packaging/ci_scope.py --check-release-tag  # a tag must match the source version and sit on main

Owner, 2026-10-06: Actions minutes are limited and Windows minutes count double. So nothing is built or
tested twice, and anything uncertain (no earlier run found, history rewritten, the API unreachable) builds
and tests:

- Linux suite. A push to main runs it in full, unless only documents changed since the last commit whose
  full suite passed: then it runs the tests that read them. Measured from that commit, not the previous push,
  so a code push whose run was cancelled still gets the full suite. A manual run skips it when an earlier
  run passed it on this exact commit. Daily and tag runs always run it.
- Windows app. A tag and a manual run build it. The daily run builds it when a file that can reach it
  changed since the last commit whose Windows build succeeded (so a failed or cancelled build is redone).
  A manual run on main reuses an earlier run's unexpired ZIP of this exact commit.
- Phone app. A manual run on main makes matched test builds; a release tag builds the same signed APK
  for the permanent Windows and Android beta release (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md › Build and release).
  The daily run builds and checks it (no key, nothing offered) when a file that reaches it changed since
  its last successful build.
